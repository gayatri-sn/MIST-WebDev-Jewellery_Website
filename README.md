# MIST-WebDev-Jewellery_Website
This repository showcases a jewelry website created as part of the MIST Web Development - Track B task. 
Designed for CLASSIQUE, a brand I came up with for the purpose of the task, the website is built using fundamental HTML and CSS. 
It features a clean and elegant design that reflects the brand's timeless aesthetic
